3. project-webperf.html: here Cameron thanks everyone, Udacity, google and you for taking some time to visit this page.
4. project-mobile.html:  Cameron shows developing for mobie is important. 	this is his recommendation.
5. pizza.html: if you are hungry, it's your chance to order a pizza from Cam's Pizzaeria that created by Cameron. 

Note: All this awesome jobs created and designed by Cameron. However, all pages have been optimized and enhanced by: Mohammed Altariqi.

The optimization aimed to speed up loading time and reduce frames. Also, I've used google PageSpeed Insights to as measurement tool.
